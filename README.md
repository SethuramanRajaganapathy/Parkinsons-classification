# Parkinsons-classification
This is a project where we have used Parkinson's dataset and tried to classify it using different ML classifiers.

We have used three classifiers.
1. XGB Classifier
2. Gradient Boosting Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting yields the most accuracy-91.03%. 
But, when a classification model is to be measured. 
The measure that might matter the most is Recall as a False positive is less important than a false negative as we are classifying a condition.

Gradient Boosting Classifier has only 5 false negatives compared to 7(XGB) and 10(RF). So, We prefer Gradient Boosting Classifier.
